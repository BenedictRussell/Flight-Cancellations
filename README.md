# Flight-Cancellations
Investigating domestic flight cancellations in the US betweent the years 2009 and 2018.

Flight cancellations are headaches for both flyers and airlines. For
airlines, knowing the volume of cancellations and whether or not
mitigating measures have been effective is vital information. Thus,
we investigate how daily cancellations are related and their over-
all trend between the 2009 and 2018. The dataset is taken from
U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s (DOT) Bureau of Transporta-
tion Statistics, covering domestic flights operated by large air
carriers. The data between 2009 and 2018 has been combined and
sorted to provide daily cancellation data, where a cancellation im-
plies an airline has cancelled a plane. It is important to contextualise
the data; falling in the wake of the 2008 economic crash and prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Therefore, trends and con-
clusions found in this dataset do not necessarily lend themselves to
future or previous time periods.
